<h2>Treatment Episode Data Set: Discharges (TEDS-D)</h2>

The Treatment Episode Data Set -- Discharges (TEDS-D) is a national data system of annual discharges from substance abuse treatment
facilities. These data provide information on the demographic and substance abuse characteristics of substance abuse treatment 
discharges and their corresponding admissions aged 12 and older in facilities that report to individual state administrative data systems.

TEDS-D does not include all admissions/discharges to substance abuse treatment. 
It includes admissions to facilities that are licensed or certified by a state substance abuse agency to provide 
substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons). In general, facilities reporting TEDS 
data are those that receive state alcohol and/or drug agency funds (including federal block grant funds) for the provision
of alcohol and/or drug treatment services. Some states report only publicly funded admissions; others are able to report all
admissions (both public and private) in facilities that receive public funds. All data reported to TEDS comes from the state 
administrative data systems.

TEDS-D records represent discharges rather than individuals, as a person may be admitted to and discharged from treatment 
more than once.

The limitations to be kept in mind when analyzing this dataset include:
- TEDS is an admission based system and therefore admissions and discharge do not represent individuals. Meaning an individual admitted and discharged twice in a year, would be counted as 2 admissions and 2 discharges.
- This data provides info on the treatment presented in specific facility, does not necessarily represent complete treatment episodes, which may include stays in multiple types of services and would require analysis of series of linked pairs of records.
- The primary, secondary and tertiary substances of abuse reported to the TEDS are those substances that led to the treatment episode and not necessarily a complete enumeration of all drugs used at the time of admission.
- The way an admission is defined may vary from state to state.
- Public funding constraints may direct states to selectively target special populations for example pregnant women or adolescents.
- Some states have no Opioid Treatment Programs that provide medication assistance therapy using methadone and/or buprenorphine.
