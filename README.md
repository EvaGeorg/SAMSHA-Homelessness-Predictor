Treatment Episode Data Set: Discharges (TEDS-D)

The Treatment Episode Data Set -- Discharges (TEDS-D) is a national data system of annual discharges from substance abuse treatment
facilities. These data provide information on the demographic and substance abuse characteristics of substance abuse treatment 
discharges and their corresponding admissions aged 12 and older in facilities that report to individual state administrative data systems.

TEDS-D does not include all admissions/discharges to substance abuse treatment. 
It includes admissions to facilities that are licensed or certified by a state substance abuse agency to provide 
substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons). In general, facilities reporting TEDS 
data are those that receive state alcohol and/or drug agency funds (including federal block grant funds) for the provision
of alcohol and/or drug treatment services. Some states report only publicly funded admissions; others are able to report all
admissions (both public and private) in facilities that receive public funds. All data reported to TEDS comes from the state 
administrative data systems.

TEDS-D records represent discharges rather than individuals, as a person may be admitted to and discharged from treatment 
more than once.

This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze, cluster, visualize and classify data.
